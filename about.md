One of my favorite thoughts was articulated by the wonderful Calvin Trillin, when he wrote about a vacation that he took with his family to France. They spent the vast majority of their trip doing what would be broadly called "hanging out," and upon returning, his school-aged children apparently got into a bit of trouble because their teachers couldn't believe that they had not gone to any of the well known tourist sites.  All foosball in a Parisian cafe and no visit to the Eiffel Tower is how to experience France with your kids.
