<h2>
It May Be Slapstick, But This Is Tragedy
</h2>
<h3>
<em>Too many people see the current situation unfolding in the United States as farce. For film director Spike Lee, it is tragedy – and he is correct.</em>
</h3>
<p>
OK, so I watch developments as if I'm back in junior high watching Monty Python for the first time. Or in high school reading Kafka for the first time. The fact that an American author does not come to mind may even be a warning: perhaps Americans just aren't so good at recognizing when things have slipped over the event horizon from flaw to farce.
</p>
<p>
Spike Lee warned us that the fault lines in our society not only still exist but run deep. Not because they never healed after 1865 – after all, to heal, you must have been whole to begin with.
</p>
<blockquote>
<em>
  The so-called American cradle of democracy, that’s bullshit. The United States of America was built on the genocide of native people and slavery. That is the fabric of the United States of America.
  </em>
</blockquote>
<p>
Lee's <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2018/05/read-it-spike-lee-and-his-anti-trump-speech-at-cannes.html">entire statement</a> – post-Hobbesian in its honesty: pithy, brutal, and short – is worth reading.
</p>
<p>
My take on farce has always been that the humor rests on shared preconceptions: you can't have someone do something outrageously laughable without a common pre-established expectation of the limits of behavior. The best farce, though, is generally not just Dada-esque randomness. Rather, a small, perhaps every-day, problem snow-balls into an avalanche of mis-understanding as characters do their best to work with incomplete information.
</p>
<p>
(Quick aside: One of my half-baked theories is that this is what makes <em>Hamlet</em> so popular. It is commonly billed as tragedy, but it has far more in common with farce. Unquestionably, the story is dark, hardly comic. But it is the farcical nature of the story-line's development – small steps, not one of which makes the audience think <em>there's no way I would do that</em> – that makes the play so popular.)
</p>
<p>
So why isn't the U.S.'s current situation farcical? Why can't we all simply agree to get by until 2020 by smugly watching Seth Meyers do his "A Closer Look" bit each night? 
</p>
<p>
Because Americans, it turns out, don't really share the basic common thread that we would need to make this a real farce. We don't, it seems, all agree on the message of that episode of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066626/"><em>All in the Family</em></a> where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfocap0Wyac">Archie gets a blood transfusion</a> from a doctor who happens to be a black woman. And without that shared concept of basic behavioral norms, we don't get farce because when someone does something "over the line" from one person's perspective, we cannot be confident that others agree. In fact, we have realized, that they do not agree.
</p>
<p>
Rather, we do have is the making of the Unites States as a tragic hero. For the ancient Greeks who invented the genre, tragic heros evolved to be expected to demonstrate a number of qualities during the course of the play. As Aristotle discussed in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetics_(Aristotle)"><em>Poetics</em></a>, the making of a tragic hero could include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>enduring a change of fortune for the worse (tautology, I suppose);</li>
  <li>suffer this downfall through some inherent flaw, frailty, or misjudgement ("hamartia" or ἁμαρτία);</li>
  <li>be reknown or noble, but neither purely good or evil, <em>i.e.</em>, famous but relatable;</li>
  <li>demonstrate some level of hubris that plays a role in the downfall; and</li>
  <li>exhibit some realization of the nature of interplay between the hubris, hamartia, and downfall.</li>  
</ul>
<p>
  (Full disclosure here: I know f-all about Greek tragedy or its academic theory. S.H. Butcher's 1902 translation of <em>Poetics</em> is <a href="https://www.stmarys-ca.edu/sites/default/files/attachments/files/Poetics.pdf">pretty easy to find</a> – but there are likely more recent analyses.)
</p>
<p>
  So even if it is half-baked and fails close scrutiny, I see the United States as currently suffering through the downfall period of a Greek tragedy. A noble country, based on the ideals of the Enlightenment, harbored a latent character flaw of racism, misjudged the effect of offering Confederate states easy re-entry to the Union, believed that the nation was too strong to be threatened by such internal divisions, and now finds itself in a Kafka-eqsu struggle for its own survival – or at least the survival of the United States as the post–World War II world knows it.
</p>
<p>
  The tragic flaw in the United States was always racism, a type that was so deeply embedded in the social and economic fiber of the states from the beginning that even people like Jefferson who no doubt knew how wrong slavery was on some level could not bring themselves to emancipate their own slaves during their lives. As one libertarian economist and Jefferson scholar noted to me, the phrase "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence">life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness</a>" in the Declaration of Independence was a modified version of John Locke's formulation of the so-called natural rights of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights#John_Locke">life, liberty, and property</a>" – and a change Jefferson made due to qualms of conscience about slavery. There are other <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-brook/the-pursuit-of-happiness_b_54827.html">competing</a> <a href="https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/46460">theories</a> about the source of the quote.
</p>
<p>
  But what is clear is that a fateful – and possibly fatal – flaw has lain latent in American culture.
</p>
<p>    
  (The un-rebuttable corollary of course being this: Racism was never latent to generations of black Americans who suffered through slavery, Jim Crow, and intimidation – and continue to suffer these preposerterous outrages.  This is 100% true.)
</p>
<p>
In the wake of the past two years, it will take, I estimate, another 40 to recover – to simply make up the lost ground, to get back to a time when the racist member of your family is someone that you roll your eyes at and warn you significant other about before the first visit to a family dinner.
</p>
<p>
As someone smarter than I quipped some time ago, it may be true that all visionaries are hypocrites but that doesn't mean we are allowed to be so as well. This time, we have to figure out how to make the United States live up to the sentiments it was founded on.
