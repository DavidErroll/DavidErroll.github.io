<h2>
It May Be Slapstick, But This Is Tragedy
</h2>
<h3>
<em>Too many people see the current situation unfolding in the United States as farce. For film director Spike Lee, it is tragedy – and he is correct.</em>

OK, so I watch developments as if I'm back in junior high watching Monty Python for the first time. Or in high school reading Kafka for the first time. The fact that an American author does not come to mind may even be a warning: perhaps Americans just aren't so good at recognizing when things have slipped over the event horizon from flaw to farce.

My take on farce has always been that the humor rests on shared preconceptions: you can't have someone do something outrageously laughable without a common pre-established expectation of the limits of behavior. The best farce, though, is generally not just Dada-esque randomness. Rather, a small, perhaps every-day, problem snow-balls into an avalanche of mis-understanding as characters do their best to work with incomplete information.

One of my half-baked theories is that this is what makes <em>Hamlet</em> so popular. It is commonly billed as tragedy, but it is has far more in common with farce. Unquestionably, the story is dark, hardly comic. But it is the farcical nature of the story-line's development – small steps, not one of which makes the audience think <em>there's no way I would do that</em> – that makes the play so popular.

So why isn't the U.S.'s current situation farcical? Why can't we all simply

Lee's <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2018/05/read-it-spike-lee-and-his-anti-trump-speech-at-cannes.html">entire statement</a> – Malthusian in its honesty: pithy, brutal, and short – is worth reading.
