<h2>
It May Be Slapstick, But This Is Tragedy
</h2>
<h3>
<em>Too many people see the current situation unfolding in the United States as farce. For film director Spike Lee, it is tragedy – and he is correct.</em>

OK, so I watch developments as if I'm back in junior high watching Monty Python for the first time. Or in high school reading Kafka for the first time. The fact that an American author does not come to mind may even be a warning: perhaps Americans just aren't so good at recognizing when things have slipped over the event horizon from flaw to farce.

The so-called American cradle of democracy, that’s bullshit. The United States of America was built on the genocide of native people and slavery. That is the fabric of the United States of America.

Lee's <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2018/05/read-it-spike-lee-and-his-anti-trump-speech-at-cannes.html">entire statement</a> – Malthusian in its honesty: pithy, brutal, and short – is worth reading.
