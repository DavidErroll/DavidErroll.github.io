<h2>
It May Be Slapstick, But This Is Tragedy
</h2>
<h3>
<em>Too many people see the current situation unfolding in the United States as farce. For film director Spike Lee, it is tragedy – and he is correct.</em>
</h3>
<p>
OK, so I watch developments as if I'm back in junior high watching Monty Python for the first time. Or in high school reading Kafka for the first time. The fact that an American author does not come to mind may even be a warning: perhaps Americans just aren't so good at recognizing when things have slipped over the event horizon from flaw to farce.
</p>
<p>
Spike Lee warned us that the fault lines in our society not only still exist but run deep. Not because they never healed after 1865 – after all, to heal, you must have been whole to begin with.

<em>
  The so-called American cradle of democracy, that’s bullshit. The United States of America was built on the genocide of native people and slavery. That is the fabric of the United States of America.
  </em>

Lee's <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2018/05/read-it-spike-lee-and-his-anti-trump-speech-at-cannes.html">entire statement</a> – post-Hobbesian in its honesty: pithy, brutal, and short – is worth reading.
</p>
<p>
My take on farce has always been that the humor rests on shared preconceptions: you can't have someone do something outrageously laughable without a common pre-established expectation of the limits of behavior. The best farce, though, is generally not just Dada-esque randomness. Rather, a small, perhaps every-day, problem snow-balls into an avalanche of mis-understanding as characters do their best to work with incomplete information.
</p>
<p>
(Quick aside: One of my half-baked theories is that this is what makes <em>Hamlet</em> so popular. It is commonly billed as tragedy, but it has far more in common with farce. Unquestionably, the story is dark, hardly comic. But it is the farcical nature of the story-line's development – small steps, not one of which makes the audience think <em>there's no way I would do that</em> – that makes the play so popular.)
</p>
<p>
So why isn't the U.S.'s current situation farcical? Why can't we all simply agree to get by until 2020 by smugly watching Seth Meyers do his "A Closer Look" bit each night? 
</p>
<p>
Because Americans, it turns out, don't really share the basic common thread that we would need to make this a real farce. We don't, it seems, all agree on the message of that episode of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066626/"><em>All in the Family</em></a> where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfocap0Wyac">Archie gets a blood transfusion</a> from a doctor who happens to be a black woman. And without that shared concept of basic behavioral norms, we don't get farce because when someone does something "over the line" from one person's perspective, we cannot be confident that others agree. In fact, we have realized, that they do not agree.
</p>
<p>
Rather, we do have is the making of a tragedy. And we are getting close to the part of the story where Dobby and Sirius are gone but Fred and George are still together.
</p>
<p>
In the wake of the past two years, it will take, I estimate, another 40 to recover, to simply make up the lost ground, to get back to when the racist member of your family is someone that you roll your eyes at and warn you significant other about before the first visit.
</p>
<p>
As someone smarter than I quipped some time ago, it may be true that all visionaries are hypocrites but that doesn't mean we are allowed to be so as well. This time, we have to figure out how to make the United States live up to the sentiments of the founders.
