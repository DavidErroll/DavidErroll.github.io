Gini Coefficient: A (somewhat) necessary side-note
</p>

<p>
One of the underlying premises of this investigation is the idea of identifying the "greatest tennis player of all time" implicitly assumes that we are not simply finding the <em>luckiest</em> player of all time.
</p>
<p>
Since ATP tennis tournaments invariably employ a single-elimination bracket-style format, the tournament is guaranteed to produce a single "winner." Ideally, this winner is the "best" player within the rules of the game. However, it is trivial to imagine games of pure luck that would also produce a winner in this format.  <em>E.g.</em>, there is no shortage of <a href="http://worldrps.com/">Rock</a>/<a href="https://kotaku.com/japans-most-intense-rock-paper-scissors-competition-1790085868">Paper</a>/<a href="https://priceonomics.com/the-world-of-competitive-rock-paper-scissors/">Scissors</a> tournaments, where while there is some element of skill in a player's ability to guess (or study) an opponent's actions, true skill is far from evident.  This, or a coin-flipping tournament, would produce a winner that would likely be best described as the luckiest rather than the best.
</p>
<p>
So there is a hypothesis that we are implicitly rejecting by searching for a greatest tennis player, <em>i.e.</em>, that not all tennis players are equally skilled.
</p>
<p>
OK – it seems a bit too obvious to even merit an effort at a proof.  After all, anyone who has played tennis – poorly, well, or first one and eventually the other – can tell you that:

<ol>
  <li>there are skills that can be taught, learned, and applied, and</li>
  <li>different people have different capacities to learn and apply these skills.</li>
</ol>

It's axiomatic.
